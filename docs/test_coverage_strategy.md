# Test Coverage Improvement Strategy for VersionTracker

This document outlines the strategy for increasing test coverage in the VersionTracker project, particularly focusing on the `apps.py` module which currently has only 22% coverage.

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Focus on Foundation Functions First**
   - Start with `is_homebrew_available()` and `get_homebrew_casks()`
   - These are core functions that many other functions depend on

2. **Use a Test-Driven Approach**
   - Write comprehensive tests with clear docstrings
   - Cover normal operation, edge cases, and error cases

3. **Mock External Dependencies**
   - Create mock data for system_profiler output
   - Patch external dependencies like `run_command` to avoid actual system calls
   - Simulate different environments (macOS vs non-macOS, ARM vs Intel)

4. **Ensure Error Paths are Tested**
   - Test all exception handling branches
   - Cover network errors, timeouts, permission issues
   - Test invalid inputs and unexpected data formats

5. **Track Progress with Focused Coverage Reports**
   ```bash
   pytest tests/test_apps.py -v --cov=versiontracker.apps --cov-report=term-missing
   ```

## Test Priority List

### 1. First Priority: Core Foundation Functions
- `is_homebrew_available()`
- `get_homebrew_casks()`

### 2. Second Priority: Data Processing Functions
- `get_applications_from_system_profiler()`
- `get_homebrew_casks_list()`
- `filter_out_brews()` (already tested)

### 3. Third Priority: Version and Update Functions
- `get_cask_version()`
- `check_brew_update_candidates()`
- `search_brew_cask()`

### 4. Fourth Priority: Helper and Utility Functions
- `is_app_in_app_store()`
- `is_brew_cask_installable()`
- `_process_brew_batch()`
- `_batch_process_brew_search()`

## Goal
The goal is to reach at least 90% test coverage for the `apps.py` module, significantly improving from the current 22%.
