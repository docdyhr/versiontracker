# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.7.2] - 2025-08-30

### Changed

- Bumped project version to 0.7.2 across metadata and package (__init__, pyproject, README)
- Updated Homebrew formula URL and version assertion to v0.7.2

### Notes

- The Homebrew tap will need its tarball sha256 refreshed after the GitHub tag is created
  and the automated tap workflow runs.

## [0.7.1] - 2025-01-14
### Fixed
- **BREAKING**: Fixed PyPI package naming conflict by changing from `versiontracker` to `macos-versiontracker`
- Fixed CI/CD release workflow version mismatch issue
- Corrected package version in `__init__.py` to allow for new releases
- Resolved Python version compatibility issues in release pipeline
- Fixed Homebrew formula repository reference

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Package name changed from `versiontracker` to `macos-versiontracker` on PyPI
- Updated installation command: `pip install macos-versiontracker`
- Added both `versiontracker` and `macos-versiontracker` CLI commands for compatibility
- Updated version from 0.7.0 to 0.7.1 to resolve PyPI publishing conflicts
- Improved release workflow error handling and validation
- Enhanced Python version compatibility (Python 3.9+ instead of 3.13+)

### Migration Guide
- **Old installation**: `pip install versiontracker` (conflicts with existing package)
- **New installation**: `pip install macos-versiontracker`
- CLI commands remain the same: `versiontracker` or use new `macos-versiontracker`
- No configuration changes required

## [0.7.0] - 2025-01-13
### Documentation Corrections (August 2025)
- Updated README: corrected overstated "70%+ test coverage" to actual ≈10–11% with rationale tied to heavy mocking strategy.
- Added "Testing Strategy & Coverage Philosophy" section detailing isolation approach, planned integration test expansion, and future meaningful coverage target (25–30%).
- Clarified current performance bottleneck (Homebrew operations) and noted upcoming async optimization initiative.

### Terminology Migration (August 2025)
- Introduced preferred term "blocklist" replacing legacy "blacklist" across CLI and handlers.
- Added `--blocklist` and `--blocklist-auto-updates` options; legacy flags retained with deprecation warnings for backward compatibility.
- Implemented new configuration accessors `get_blocklist()` / `is_blocklisted()` while preserving legacy `get_blacklist()` / `is_blacklisted()`.
- Updated application listing and auto-update handlers to use blocklist terminology internally.
- No breaking changes: existing scripts using legacy flags continue to function.
- Upcoming: README and usage examples will be updated to highlight the new terminology and deprecation timeline.

### Async Homebrew Prototype & Integration Test Plan (August 2025)
- Added experimental asynchronous Homebrew access layer (`async_homebrew_prototype.py`) gated by `VERSIONTRACKER_ASYNC_BREW` feature flag (thread offloading wrapper; future native async support).
- Introduced `AsyncHomebrewClient` with batch cask retrieval, search, and cache warming capabilities.
- Provided convenience top-level async functions (`async_get_cask_info`, `async_get_casks_info`, `async_search_casks`) for early adopters; no breaking changes to existing sync paths.
- Created initial integration test strategy document (`tests/integration_test_plan.md`) outlining phased suites (INT-001–INT-020) targeting coverage lift to 25–30%.
- Established parity objective & future async regression safeguards (output equivalence baseline).
- Next steps: implement Phase 1 integration suites (INT-001–INT-005) and begin performance benchmarking of async batching.


### Homebrew Formula Preparation (August 2025)
- Revised `versiontracker.rb` to:
  - Update Python dependency to `python@3.13` to match project requirement (`requires-python >=3.13`).
  - Switch to `virtualenv_install_with_resources` pattern.
  - Add resource stubs for all first-level Python dependencies with TODO hash placeholders where needed.
  - Insert caveats with checklist for replacing placeholder sha256 values and running `brew audit`.
- Added detailed Homebrew release preparation checklist to TODO.md (formula checksum, audit, tap creation, automation).
- Pending actions before publishing:
  - Compute and replace main tarball sha256 (`PLACEHOLDER_SHA256`).
  - Fill placeholder resource sha256 values (rapidfuzz, tqdm, and any uncommented transitive dependencies).
  - Run: `brew audit --new-formula --strict versiontracker`.
  - Create tap repo `homebrew-versiontracker` and publish formula under `Formula/`.
- No functional runtime changes to core package; distribution enhancement only.
