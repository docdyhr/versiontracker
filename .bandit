# Specific test exclusions:
# B101: assert_used - Assert statements are used in tests and validation
# B110: try_except_pass - Used for non-critical error handling where continuation is desired
# B404: subprocess module import - Required for system command execution (homebrew commands)
# B602: subprocess with shell=True - Intentional for homebrew command execution with controlled input
# B603: subprocess without shell - Safe usage with controlled inputs for brew commands
# B607: partial path - brew command is expected to be in PATH on macOS systems
# B608: hardcoded_sql_expressions - False positive in cache error messages using f-strings
