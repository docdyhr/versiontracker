# VersionTracker Roadmap

This document outlines the planned improvements and features for VersionTracker.

## ✅ Recently Completed (January 2025)

### Major Technical Debt Cleanup - COMPLETED ✅

- [x] **Critical Function Complexity Reduction**
  - [x] `compare_versions()` function: Reduced complexity from 76 to 10 (86% reduction)
  - [x] `parse_version()` function: Reduced complexity from 45 to 4 (91% reduction)
  - [x] `Config._load_from_env()` method: Reduced complexity from 37 to 1 (97% reduction)
- [x] **Test Coverage Revolution**: Improved from 20.4% to 70.02% (243% increase)
- [x] **Code Quality Improvements**: Removed duplicate code, fixed naming conflicts
- [x] **100% Test Pass Rate**: All 962 tests pass consistently

### Code Structure and Organization - COMPLETED ✅

- [x] Refactor `__main__.py` into smaller modules (moved handler functions to dedicated `handlers/` directory)
- [x] Implement command pattern for better extension of CLI commands
- [x] Standardize docstring format across the codebase
- [x] Complete type hinting coverage across all modules

### Testing Improvements - COMPLETED ✅

- [x] Implement parameterized tests to reduce code duplication
- [x] Create mock server for network operation testing
- [x] Add integration tests for real-world usage scenarios
- [x] Improve test coverage for edge cases (network timeouts, malformed responses)

### Performance Optimizations - COMPLETED ✅

- [x] Implement efficient caching mechanism for Homebrew queries
- [x] Explore using `asyncio` for network operations
- [x] Add request batching to reduce network calls

## Short-Term Goals (Next 3 Months)

### High & Medium-Priority Complexity Function Refactoring ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] `handle_brew_recommendations()` in brew_handlers.py (complexity 37) - COMPLETED ✅
- [x] `_compare_prerelease_suffixes()` in version.py (complexity 32) - COMPLETED ✅
- [x] `is_brew_cask_installable()` in apps.py (complexity 26) - COMPLETED ✅
- [x] `get_version_difference()` in version.py (complexity 26) - COMPLETED ✅
- [x] `ConfigValidator.validate_config()` in config.py (complexity 23) - COMPLETED ✅
- [x] `run_command()` in utils.py (complexity 18) - COMPLETED ✅
- [x] `get_json_data()` in utils.py (complexity 15) - COMPLETED ✅

### Test Coverage Growth (70.66% → 85% Goal)

- [ ] Advanced cache module coverage improvement (currently 0%)
