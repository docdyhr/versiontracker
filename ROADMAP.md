# VersionTracker Roadmap

This document outlines the planned improvements and features for VersionTracker.

## Short-Term Goals (Next 3 Months)

### Code Structure and Organization

- [ ] Refactor `__main__.py` into smaller modules (move handler functions to a dedicated `handlers.py`)
- [ ] Implement a command pattern for better extension of CLI commands
- [ ] Standardize docstring format across the codebase
- [ ] Complete type hinting coverage across all modules

### Testing Improvements

- [ ] Implement parameterized tests to reduce code duplication
- [ ] Create a mock server for network operation testing
- [ ] Add integration tests for real-world usage scenarios
- [ ] Improve test coverage for edge cases (network timeouts, malformed responses)

### Performance Optimizations

- [ ] Implement a more efficient caching mechanism for Homebrew queries
- [ ] Explore using `asyncio` for network operations
- [ ] Add request batching to reduce network calls

## Medium-Term Goals (3-6 Months)

### User Experience Enhancements

- [ ] Add more granular progress indicators for long-running operations
- [ ] Implement an interactive shell mode for advanced usage
- [ ] Improve error messages with actionable suggestions
- [ ] Create a configuration wizard for first-time users

### Developer Experience

- [ ] Set up pre-commit hooks for code formatting and linting
- [ ] Implement automated versioning and releases using GitHub Actions
- [ ] Add dependency scanning for security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Create detailed contribution guidelines

### Documentation

- [ ] Generate comprehensive API documentation using Sphinx
- [ ] Create additional usage examples and tutorials
- [ ] Write architecture documentation for contributors
- [ ] Improve inline code documentation

## Long-Term Goals (6-12 Months)

### Feature Enhancements

- [ ] Add support for additional package managers (MacPorts, etc.)
- [ ] Implement automatic update capabilities for Homebrew-manageable applications
- [ ] Add scheduled checks with notifications for outdated applications
- [ ] Create a plugin system for extending functionality

### Platform Extensions

- [ ] Explore extending support beyond macOS to Linux
- [ ] Investigate Windows compatibility options
- [ ] Implement platform-specific optimizations

### GUI and Integration

- [ ] Develop a simple GUI interface
- [ ] Create system tray/menu bar integration
- [ ] Add notification center integration
- [ ] Explore potential system extension integration

## Future Considerations

### Advanced Features

- [ ] Application health monitoring (crash reports, resource usage)
- [ ] Security vulnerability scanning for installed applications
- [ ] Software license management and tracking
- [ ] Integration with enterprise management systems

### Community Building

- [ ] Set up a community forum or discussion board
- [ ] Create a public roadmap voting system
- [ ] Establish a regular release cycle
- [ ] Develop a contributor recognition program

## Continuous Improvements

- Regular dependency updates and security audits
- Performance optimization based on user feedback
- User experience refinements
- Documentation updates and improvements
