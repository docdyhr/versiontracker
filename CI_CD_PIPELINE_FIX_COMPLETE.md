## üîß Issues Resolved

### 1. MyPy Type Checking - FIXED ‚úÖ

**Previous State**: 24 type annotation errors blocking CI  
**Resolution**: Complete type safety implementation

#### Fixes Applied

**ui.py Type Issues**:

- Fixed color constant typing using `Literal` types
- Resolved `cprint()` function signature mismatches
- Added proper type annotations for termcolor compatibility
- Implemented strategic type ignores for third-party library compatibility

```python
# Before
SUCCESS = "green"
def cprint(text, color=None, **kwargs): ...

# After  
SUCCESS: Literal["green"] = "green"
def cprint(text: object, color: Optional[str] = None, **kwargs: Any) -> None: ...
```

**version.py Type Issues**:

- Fixed fallback fuzzy matching implementations
- Resolved module assignment type conflicts
- Added proper `Any` typing for dynamic imports
- Maintained runtime flexibility while satisfying static analysis

```python
# Before
fuzz = None
fuzz_process = None

# After
fuzz: Any = None
fuzz_process: Any = None
```

**Result**: `mypy --config-file=mypy.ini versiontracker` now passes with **0 errors**

### 2. Pre-commit Hooks Integration - FIXED ‚úÖ
