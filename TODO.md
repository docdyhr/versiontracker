  - [x] Add Python 3.13 to test matrix (already implemented)
  - [x] Implement automated dependency updates (enhanced Dependabot configuration)
  - [x] Set up automated performance regression testing (new workflow created)

- [x] **Documentation Overhaul**
  - [x] Update README.md with latest features and examples (async, caching, profiling)
  - [x] Create comprehensive contributing guidelines (CONTRIBUTING.md)
  - [x] Add architecture documentation for new contributors (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)

### System Integration

- [x] **macOS Integration**
  - [x] Add launchd service for scheduled application checking
  - [x] Implement macOS notifications for update alerts
  - [x] Create menubar application for quick access

## üîÆ Long-term Goals

### Security and Monitoring

- [ ] **Vulnerability Management**
  - [ ] Integrate with vulnerability databases (NVD, CVE)
  - [ ] Alert on applications with known security issues
  - [ ] Provide update recommendations for security-critical apps

### GUI and Web Interface

- [ ] **Modern Interface Development**
  - [ ] Develop web-based interface using FastAPI
  - [ ] Add dark/light mode support
  - [ ] Implement interactive filtering and sorting

### Plugin System

- [ ] **Extensibility Framework**

  - [ ] Support user-contributed package manager plugins
  - [ ] Create plugin repository and discovery mechanism

## üêõ Known Issues

### Compatibility and Edge Cases

- [ ] **Platform Compatibility**
  - [ ] Test compatibility with Apple Silicon vs Intel Homebrew paths
  - [ ] Verify compatibility with Python 3.13+ (currently testing 3.10-3.12)
  - [ ] Ensure compatibility with various macOS versions (Monterey through Sequoia)

- [ ] **Error Handling Improvements**
  - [ ] Better handling of applications with irregular version formats
  - [ ] Improved error handling for network timeouts and connectivity issues
  - [ ] Enhanced fuzzy matching accuracy for similar application names
