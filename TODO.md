# VersionTracker TODO

## Homebrew Release Preparation Checklist (Detailed)

These steps expand the existing high‚Äëlevel Homebrew release phases to ensure the `versiontracker` formula is
reproducible, auditable, and automation-ready.

1. Pre‚ÄëRelease Validation
   - [ ] Confirm target version tag exists locally & remotely: `git fetch --tags && git tag -l v0.6.5`
   - [ ] Ensure CHANGELOG has an entry for this version and no "[Unreleased]" items that should be moved.
   - [ ] Run full test suite locally: `pytest` (ensure exit code 0).
   - [ ] Validate packaging: `python -m build` (wheel + sdist).

2. Source Tarball & Checksum
   - [ ] Download canonical GitHub tag archive:
         `curl -L -o v0.6.5.tar.gz https://github.com/docdyhr/versiontracker/archive/refs/tags/v0.6.5.tar.gz`
   - [ ] Compute checksum: `shasum -a 256 v0.6.5.tar.gz`
   - [ ] Replace `PLACEHOLDER_SHA256` in `versiontracker.rb` with the computed value.

3. Formula Dependency Alignment
   - [ ] Verify Python version in formula matches project requirement (`python@3.13`).
   - [ ] Cross‚Äëcheck first‚Äëlevel runtime deps (fuzzywuzzy, rapidfuzz, tqdm, PyYAML, termcolor, tabulate, psutil,
         aiohttp) with `pyproject.toml`.
   - [ ] For any added deps (e.g., rapidfuzz version/hash), resolve exact tarball SHA256 via:
         `pip download <package>==<version> --no-binary :all:`
         then `shasum -a 256 <file>.tar.gz`
   - [ ] Decide if transitive aiohttp deps need explicit resources (run `brew audit` first; only add if required).

4. Formula Integrity & Audit
   - [ ] Run: `brew audit --new-formula --strict ./versiontracker.rb`
   - [ ] Address any style / resource / license warnings.
   - [ ] Test local install:
         `brew install --build-from-source ./versiontracker.rb`
   - [ ] Smoke test:
         `versiontracker --version`
         `versiontracker --help`
         `versiontracker --apps --no-progress` (expect graceful run even if environment data minimal)

5. Tap Repository Creation
   - [ ] Create `homebrew-versiontracker` repository (public).
   - [ ] Add directory `Formula/` and place `versiontracker.rb` inside.
   - [ ] Commit with message: `feat: add versiontracker 0.6.5 formula`.
   - [ ] Push and test tap:
         `brew tap docdyhr/versiontracker`
         `brew install versiontracker`

6. Documentation Updates
   - [ ] README: Update Installation section to prefer:
         ```
     brew tap docdyhr/versiontracker
         brew install versiontracker
         ```
   - [ ] Add troubleshooting note (e.g., if Python framework conflicts occur).
   - [ ] CHANGELOG: Add "Added Homebrew formula distribution" under the released version.

7. Release Publishing
   - [ ] Draft GitHub Release `v0.6.5` referencing CHANGELOG notes.
   - [ ] Attach (optional) built artifacts (sdist, wheel) if desired (PyPI already covers distribution).
   - [ ] Publish release and verify CI release workflow (if applicable).

8. Post‚ÄëPublish Validation
   - [ ] Fresh machine/container test:
         `brew untap docdyhr/versiontracker || true`
         `brew tap docdyhr/versiontracker`
         `brew install versiontracker`
   - [ ] Run a basic command that triggers version logic:
         `versiontracker --outdated --no-progress` (should not crash; network-dependent portions may warn gracefully).

9. Automation Setup (Phase 4 Prep)
   - [ ] Create a workflow in main repo to:
         - On new tag push: regenerate formula (update url + sha256) in tap repo via authenticated commit or PR.
   - [ ] (Optional) Add a script `scripts/update_formula.py` to:
         - Fetch tag
         - Compute checksum
         - Patch `versiontracker.rb`
         - Commit + open PR in tap repository
   - [ ] Add a status badge for tap installation (optional).

10. Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add bottle support after formula accepted (run `brew test-bot` in CI/macOS runners).
- [ ] Consider adding a `--json` summary flag to improve future audit automation.
- [ ] Add integration tests that execute `versiontracker` within the virtualenv created by the formula (separate workflow).

Tracking

- Progress metrics: (a) formula audit success, (b) install success on clean environment, (c) tap latency from push to install.
- Record completion dates in this checklist as they are executed.
