# Branch Protection Setup Summary

## Applied Protection Rules

Your VersionTracker repository now has comprehensive branch protection configured for the
`master` branch with the following security measures:

### Status Check Requirements

- **Test Python 3.10 on ubuntu-latest** ✅
- **Test Python 3.11 on ubuntu-latest** ✅  
- **Test Python 3.12 on ubuntu-latest** ✅
- **Test Python 3.10 on macos-latest** ✅
- **Test Python 3.11 on macos-latest** ✅
- **Test Python 3.12 on macos-latest** ✅
- **lint / lint** ✅
- **security / security-scan** ✅

### Core Protection Features

- ✅ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
- ✅ **Require branches to be up to date before merging**
- ✅ **Require linear history** (no merge commits)
- ✅ **Prevent force pushes**
- ✅ **Prevent branch deletion**
- ✅ **Dismiss stale reviews when new commits are pushed**
- ✅ **Admin enforcement enabled** (maximum security)
- ✅ **Require code owner reviews** (via existing CODEOWNERS file)
- ✅ **Require conversation resolution before merging**

## GPG Signing Configuration

Your repository is configured to work with GPG signed commits. To ensure all commits are signed:

```bash
# Verify your GPG key is configured
git config --get user.signingkey

# Enable automatic signing for all commits
git config --global commit.gpgsign true

# Sign specific commits manually
git commit -S -m "Your commit message"
```

## Development Workflow

With these protections in place, your development workflow should follow this pattern:

1. Create a feature branch
2. Make your changes and commit (with GPG signing)
3. Push to GitHub
4. Create a Pull Request via GitHub UI or CLI
5. Wait for CI checks to pass
6. Merge the PR once all checks are green

### Commands Reference

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make changes and commit with signing
git add .
git commit -S -m "feat: your feature description"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Create Pull Request
gh pr create --title "Your PR Title" --body "Description of changes"
```

The PR will only be mergeable after all test suites pass, linting checks pass,
security scans complete successfully, and code owner review if required.

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### Repository Level

- **Required status checks** ensure code quality
- **Linear history** maintains clean git history
- **Force push protection** prevents accidental history rewrites
- **Admin enforcement** means even you must follow the rules
- **Code owner reviews** ensure all changes are reviewed

### Commit Level

- **GPG signing** verifies commit authenticity
- **Conversation resolution** ensures all feedback is addressed

## Manual Verification Steps

Please verify the following in your GitHub repository settings:

1. Go to Settings → Branches
2. Verify the `master` branch protection rule is active
3. Check "Require signed commits" is enabled
4. Confirm all status checks are listed

## Additional Recommendations

### Security Enhancements

- [ ] Enable **Dependabot security updates** in repository settings
- [ ] Consider enabling **"Restrict pushes that create files"** for maximum security
- [ ] Set up **branch deletion protection** for important feature branches
- [ ] Enable **vulnerability alerts** for dependencies

### Workflow Improvements

- [ ] Add **branch naming conventions** in contributing guidelines
- [ ] Consider **semantic commit messages** (you're already using some)
- [ ] Set up **automated dependency updates** via Dependabot
- [ ] Add **release automation** with semantic versioning

### Monitoring

- [ ] Enable **GitHub Advanced Security** features if available
- [ ] Set up **code scanning alerts**
- [ ] Monitor **security advisories** for your dependencies

## Scripts Created

Two scripts have been created for future reference:

- `setup-branch-protection.sh` - Basic protection suitable for solo development
- `setup-branch-protection-enhanced.sh` - Enhanced protection with all security features

These scripts can be run again if you need to update protection rules or set up similar
rules for other branches.

## Support

If you need to modify these rules in the future:

```bash
# View current protection status
gh api repos/docdyhr/versiontracker/branches/master/protection

# Re-run setup scripts
./setup-branch-protection-enhanced.sh

# Manual API calls for specific changes
gh api --method PUT -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
  "/repos/docdyhr/versiontracker/branches/master/protection" \
  --input protection-config.json
```
